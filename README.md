<h2>Lesson 41. "DB Cascade"</h2>

When we have some relation between tables it will cause to some
complexities by some operations.
    E.g. we have two tables with the relationship <b>"One-To-Many"</b>:
let it be tables <b>'Person'</b> and <b>'Ordered_item'</b>. So that one
<b>person can have some orders</b>:

    CREATE TABLE Person (
        id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        name varchar(100),
        age int CHECK (age >=0 )
    );

    CREATE TABLE Ordered_item (
        order_id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
        user_id int REFERENCES Person(id),
        item_name varchar(100)
    );


Note: it seems, that word 'order' is reserved in PostgreSQL. Because
of it we have here table named <b>'Ordered_item'</b>
